2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-16#1 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.356 ns between NB/U0/inst_blk_mem_gen/gnbram.gnativebmg.native_blk_mem_gen/valid.cstr/ramloop[0].ram.r/prim_init.ram/DEVICE_7SERIES.NO_BMM_INFO.SP.CASCADED_PRIM36.ram_B/CLKARDCLK (clocked by clk_out2_Pixel_Clock) and sprite/dataOut_reg/D (clocked by clk_out1_Pixel_Clock). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#1 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch sprite/nootH_reg[0] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin sprite/nootH_reg[0]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#2 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch sprite/nootH_reg[1] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin sprite/nootH_reg[1]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#3 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch sprite/nootH_reg[2] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin sprite/nootH_reg[2]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#4 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch sprite/nootH_reg[3] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin sprite/nootH_reg[3]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#5 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch sprite/nootH_reg[4] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin sprite/nootH_reg[4]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#6 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch sprite/nootH_reg[5] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin sprite/nootH_reg[5]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#7 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch sprite/nootH_reg[6] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin sprite/nootH_reg[6]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#8 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch sprite/nootH_reg[7] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin sprite/nootH_reg[7]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#9 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch sprite/nootH_reg[8] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin sprite/nootH_reg[8]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#10 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch sprite/nootH_reg[9] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin sprite/nootH_reg[9]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>
